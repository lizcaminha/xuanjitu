# Interactive Xuanji Tu
## Introduction to the poem

*Xuanji Tu* or 璇璣圖 (Star Gauge, lit. *Armillary Sphere Diagram*) is a palindrome poem (*Huiwen* or 回文) written by fourth century poet Su Hui. Known for its complexity, the poem is estimated to have nearly eight thousand different readings (most of them rhyming), including top-to-bottom, left-to-right, diagonally, reversed, and inside each color chart. It has been extensively studied as one of the most complex works of the palindrome poetry genre.

It is organized in a 29x29 grid. Since the Ming Dynasty, the central character (before that, ommitted) is 心 (*xin*), meaning *heart*. It's composed of five color-coded books:
* Four black 6x6 squares (黑书, *heishu*)
* Four blue 6x13 (or 13x6) rectangles (蓝书, *lanshu*)
* Four yellow 4x4 squares and a 5x5 central ring (黄书, *huang shu*)
* Four purple (sometimes green) 5x4 rectangles (紫书, *zishu*)
* All outlined and separated by red "rails" (红书, *hongshu*). 心 is also a red word.

The poem talks about solitude. Of grief and lost love. Of the day-to-day of a woman with a broken heart. It has been said it was only comprehensible to Duo Tao, Su Hui's husband, whose betrayal drove her to write Xuanji Tu.

## About the project
This repository is a work-in-progress of an interactive Star Gauge website, where the user is driven to find as many different readings as possible, drawing from a database of previous scholar analyses of the poem, from as early as the Tang Dynasty to as recently as modern day. Perhaps there are other readings that haven't been considered yet. There is much to see. I intend for this to be as useful as a tool than as a toy.

I am building this as a personal project, and it is my most challenging one yet. Please note I am not a skilled developer, and this is my first time trying many things. I also know next to nothing of Mandarin Chinese. I'm just an enthusiast of poetry and coding!

## Contributing
The source will stay free and open for anyone.

Pull requests and forks are very welcome. I am open to learn everything I can about chinese literature and coding. I'll try to make this code as readable as I can to compensate for the admittedly hard to swallow source material. I will be grateful for any kind of help at all, be it with the backend part, the front end part, or even the language part!

I am the only one maintaining the repository.
Thank you for reading.
